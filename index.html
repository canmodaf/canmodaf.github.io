  <p><i>"Furthermore, modafinil appears to be well-tolerated, with a low rate of adverse events and a low liability to abuse. Modafinil has a number of neurochemical actions in the brain, which may be related to primary effects on catecholaminergic systems. These effects are in general advantageous for cognitive processes."</i> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17712350">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17712350</a></p>

  <p><i>"This effect appears to reduce impulsive responding, suggesting that modafinil may be of benefit in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder."</i> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12417966">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12417966</a></p>
